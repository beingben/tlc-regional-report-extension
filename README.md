# TLC Regional Report Viewer

## Overview

The TLC Regional Report Viewer is a Chrome extension designed to streamline the extraction and downloading of information from Trail Life Connect (TLC) in CSV format. Tailored for the "All Member Search" page at [https://www.traillifeconnect.com/user/all](https://www.traillifeconnect.com/user/all), the extension allows users to utilize the page's existing filtering capabilities to obtain specific data, including names, roles, troop names, and troop cities from search results.
